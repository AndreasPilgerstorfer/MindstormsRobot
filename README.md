# MindstormsRobot
In this project a fellow student, Alexander Sch√∂nmann, and I have programmed a Lego mindstorms EV3 robot by using Java and the Eclipse IDE.  The user can drive the robot by using a remote control. It is possible to turn left/right as well as driving forwards and backwards. There is also the possibility to switch to self driving mode. The purpose of this mode is that small objects can be picked up from the robot and dropped off the table where                 the robot is standing. First of all the robot starts piking up the object in front of him by using his claw arm. Then the robot starts driving forward.  If the robots detects a barrier in his way he is going to dodge the obstacle in a certain direction. When the robot reaches the table edge, he is going to stop  and drop the object off the edge without falling down as well.
